# Gesture-Volume-Control-Using-Python
Built a hand gesture volume controller using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. It uses your webcam to track your hand in real-time and changes the macOS volume when you move your index finger up or down compared to your thumb. This tool works only on macOS using AppleScript to control the volume.
